## Install (One Time)

2. Double-click **`GACS.py`**
3. Focus GTA game window
4. Wait for betting round
5. Press **=** to start

## What It Does

- Loses first round intentionally ($100)
- Wins next 4 rounds (profit $330000k per round)
- Repeats forever

## Troubleshooting

- **"Tesseract not found"** → Run `setup.bat` again
- **Clicks wrong spot** → Make sure GTA is in **Borderless Windowed** mode
